# Pressure-Cooker-A-Chef-s-Nightmare

- Pressure Cooker is a top-down cooking game where the player controls a chef and completes cooking quests by finding ingredients within a limited time. At the start of each round, the player selects a dish to make, which determines the ingredients required and the number of points that can be earned.
  
- Ingredients are placed around the map, with higher-quality ingredients positioned farther away from the chef. The player explores the field to collect items while managing a timer that decreases as levels progress. The game does not provide directions to ingredients, only live distance updates, requiring the player to decide where to move based on limited information.
  
- Progression is based on meeting a minimum point quota at the end of each level. Extra points can be converted into additional time for the next level, while failing to meet the quota results in penalties or a replay option. Each new level reduces the available time, increasing difficulty.
  
- The scope of the project focuses on implementing multiple levels with consistent mechanics rather than a single highly detailed level. The goal is to deliver a playable demo that demonstrates level progression, and time pressure through gameplay.
